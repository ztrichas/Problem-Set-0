Function 0: Function detects if the number is even by seeing if there is a remainder when dividing by two
Function 1:Function determines the length of a number by using a counter and dividing, counting the number of times that happens
Function 2:Divides the number by 10 repeatedly and counts the remainders, then adds them together
Function 3:Takes the sum of all the lesser ints
Function 4:Gets the factorial of the number
Function 5:Determines whether the first number is a factor of the 2nd
Function 6:Determines whether a number is prime by dividing it by 2,3,5, and 7, which are the only things that would determine if it wasnt prime
Function 7:Determines whether the number is perfect by taking the number and seeing if its factors added together equal the number
Function 8:Determines if the sum of the digits divides evenly into the number, and calls on the previous sum_digits function
